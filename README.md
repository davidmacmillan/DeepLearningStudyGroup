### Paper for April 29, 2025:
Why do LLMs attend to the first token?  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02732  
As background, Evan Miller has a blog from 2023 on this issue and identified a simple fix:   
add +1 in the transformer softmax denominators (but not to the final LLM output softmax).  
https://www.evanmiller.org/attention-is-off-by-one.html    
Tracing the heritage, tonight's paper on pg. 3 references Xiao 2024  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453   
and Xiao (pg. 4 & 6) notes his StreamingLLM approach for attention sinks can  
(perhaps) be eliminated if one instead uses Miller's +1 softmax recommendation.

### Paper for January 28, 2025:   
READ THIS FIRST:   
This is a long paper (68 pages).    
They are doing some cool, non-standard stuff with transformers.

The "assigned reading" is Architecture, pages 21-37 (first part of Appendix), including Algorithms & Figures.   
Skim the rest of the paper, as needed, to understand their context / what they are trying to do.

If time permits (it likely will) we will discuss (this week's new reading "assignment"):   
* Section 3.3 through end of Section 3.3.4 (~pages 8 - 14)

* Section 5 (skim for what whatever results catch your interest) (~pages 28 - 51)   
* Any Figures and Tables that are referenced in the above readings.   
* Anything anywhere in the paper that you want to discuss.

### Paper for November 12, 2024:   
The Llama 3 Herd of Models   
https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783   
This is a long paper (92 pg) so we are skipping the sections on hardware, inference and results (leaves ~30 pg to read).   
Our focus is on the software and architecture, including multi-modal aspects (the "assignment").   
At the meetup we will discuss the paper, not read through it. Bring your questions, comments, etc.   
Anyone is welcome to attend and listen without reading the "assignment".   
If nobody reads it, the meeting will be short.   
On the other hand, feel free to read more than the "assignment" and to share your wider insights in the meeting!   
Here is the "assigned" reading with precise Sections shown:   
* From the start through end of Section 3.2.1 (~pages 1 - 8)   
* Section 3.4 through end of Section 4.3.7 (~pages 14-28)   
* Section 7 through end of Section 7.5.7 (~pages 54-61)   
* Section 8 through end of Section 8.3.2 (~pages 63-66)   
* Any Figures and Tables that are referenced in the above readings.   

A copy of the paper with the above sections marked is in this Github here:

This is a short, very useful backgrounder on randomized projections,  
here used for compressed sensing, in a blog post by Terence Tao  
https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/compressed-sensing-and-single-pixel-cameras/  

and the same story told with illustrations on the Nuit Blanche blog:
